				<p>Timothy Lee McKenzie (born 4 January 1989), better known by his stage name Labrinth, is an English rapper, singer, songwriter and record producer.

				<p>After initially pursuing a career in music production, Simon Cowell signed him to his record label Syco Music as a recording artist, becoming the first singer who Cowell signed without having competed on a talent show in six years. Labrinth collaborated with the English rapper Tinie Tempah, appearing as an uncredited featured artist on the single "Pass Out", and later officially on "Frisky"; before releasing his first solo single, "Let the Sun Shine" in September 2010, all three of which peaked in the top five on the UK Singles Chart.

				<p>His debut album, Electronic Earth (2012), peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart and spawned four top five singles in the United Kingdom, including the single "Beneath Your Beautiful", which became his first song to reach the top 40 on the US Billboard Hot 100, while reaching number one in the United Kingdom, and receiving a nomination for Best British Single at the Brit Awards. In November 2014, he released the single "Jealous", which was later certified Platinum in the United Kingdom. In 2018, Labrinth formed the supergroup LSD with Australian singer-songwriter Sia and American DJ and producer Diplo. They released their self-titled debut album the following year.
				</p>
				<p>He has been referred to as “one of the most important British musicians of his generation.” Labrinth has worked with numerous artists as a songwriter and producer including Beyoncé, Kanye West, and the Weeknd. His production work on the Weeknd's album Beauty Behind the Madness earned him a Grammy Award for Album of the Year nomination. He also co-produced the soundtrack The Lion King: The Gift, and co-wrote the single "Spirit", alongside Beyoncé and Ilya Salmanzadeh, for which he received nominations at the Grammy Awards, Golden Globe Awards, and the Critics' Choice Movie Awards.
